# Bootstrap Websites by Bastiaan Haaksema
This repository contains four websites that all use the Bootstrap framework to some extent. These websites are independently created by me, except for the hanze2 website which was a group project when I studied at Hanze University of Applied Sciences. I developed these websites around 2015/2016, and were among the very first programming projects of mine, consequently also the reason for the very poor quality of code. Nevertheless, I hope it shows my experience with the Bootstrap framework.

Non of these websites are still hosted (some of them never were). If you'd like to check these websites out please run them locally on a service such as XAMPP, which is what I mainly used when I developed these websites. Some more details:
- personal1: A website describing some of my personal interests at the time.
- personal2: A single page version of personal1 which was just a trial of a Bootstrap template.
- hanze1: A hub of books that I needed while studying HBO-ICT, intended for personal use.
- hanze2: My very first group project at Hanze University of Applied Sciences, unfortunately the database is missing which the website required to run.
